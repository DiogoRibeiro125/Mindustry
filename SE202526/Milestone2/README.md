# Code metrics
Add a folder for each student, using their first and last name as the folder title. 
For example, if the student's name is Miguel Goulao, the folder name would be `MiguelGoulao`.
Each folder should contain a `README.md` file that includes the code metrics analysis performed by the student, as well as the review conducted by one or more colleagues `review.md`. The folder should also include any data files with the metrics and images the team finds useful.
