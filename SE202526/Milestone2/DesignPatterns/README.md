# Design Patterns Specification
Add a folder for each student, using their first and last name as the folder title. 
For example, if the student is named Miguel Goulao, the folder name would be `MiguelGoulao`.
Each folder should contain a `README.md` file that includes the design patterns analysis by that student, as well as the review conducted by one or more colleagues `review.md`. The folder should also include any data files with the metrics and images the team finds useful.
